## Description

---

CatWorx Badge Maker is my first coding application using C#! Following the steps from the C# tutorial from my coding boot camp continuation course, I have been introduce to the basis of C#. This app creates employee badges that display a name, ID, and employee photo. Users have the choice to manually input employee info or use an API to fetch random pseudo-employee data to create ten example badges. Of course this program is meant to simulate an application a company would use to create employee badges.

## Technologies

---

### C#

- Use of the .NET framework to run the program, similar to Node
- Created different classes for each function of the app
- Used API `https://randomuser.me/api/?results=10&nat=us&inc=name,id,picture` for generating random employees

### .NET

- Installed .NET packages for different tools to help create badges
- `System` is a collection of commonly used methods, data types, and data structures, which are the essential building blocks of a C# application
- `System.Collections.Generic`: Contains interfaces and classes that define generic collections
- `System.IO`: Directory & StreamWriter class tells us that it falls under the `System.IO` namespace
- `System.Net`: Uses the WebClient class to send HTTP requests, read files, download webpages, and upload data
- `System.Drawing`: To use the Image class, we need to reference the System.Drawing namespace
- `Newtonsoft.Json.Linq`: Gives access to a new class called JObject that will allow us to parse the JSON
